# MIT_6S191_LABS

I had the incredible opportunity to immerse myself in the world of cutting-edge technology 
by enrolling in MIT's renowned 6S191 class focused on deep learning. This intellectually
invigorating experience provided me with an in-depth understanding of the intricacies of neural networks, 
algorithms, and machine learning techniques.
And these are the labs that i took :) .
